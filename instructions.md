# Instructions for running your own generated text workshop

This workshop was designed to facilitate discussions among students around the kind of answers large language models produce, what they do well and poorly, and how what they producea can give hints as to the way they were designed.
It required no technical experience to facilitate or engage with, and can be feasibly adapted to be specific to different fields, should you want to do that.

1. Write a question for a large language model to produce an answer to. This can be any level of difficulty/technicality, although I would suggest something of the level the students are expected to produce themselves. It is also a good idea to give the LLM a word limit. Some examples of questions are provided below:
  - In 300 words, critically evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence on the aviation industry.
  - In 500 words, discuss the impact of `food deserts` on poverty in the Unites States.
  - To what extent can human action understanding be explained by mirror neurones? Answer in 300 words.
2. Put this question into an LLM such as chatGPT3 and copy the answer on to a worksheet you've already prepared.
3. Add some questions for the students, examples of which can be seen in the `gen_text_workshopV1.pdf` file.

As far as running the workshop goes, again the framework here is flexible. It can be easily tailored for students with more or less experience with AI, and can be steered in different directions depending on what is most interesting to them. Be sure to encourage the students to discuss the questions among themselves, and challenge them to justify their points.

The first workshop I ran took ~ 40 minutes, and resulted in some great discussions about the limitations of GPT3. I imagine this will change drastically next year with increasing access to far more complex LLMs.
