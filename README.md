# generated_text_workshop
A formal home for materials relating to the Generated Text Workshop I delivered as part of my teaching on the UCIL Robot Overlords unit at the University of Manchester

- `gen_text_workshopV1.pdf` is the first version of this workshop that was run
- `instructions.md` tells you how to run the workshop in detail
- The `comments` folder contains is for you to add to. Let me and others know what works and what doesn't
